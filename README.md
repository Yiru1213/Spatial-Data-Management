# Spatial Data and Asset Management

## Overview

This project focuses on the asset management of construction huts and includes a hierarchical pyramid to show how the assets and decisions based on the information about those assets nest upwards.

## Workflow

1.  Create the physical database for the asset management of construction huts

-   Create tables: createtable.sql

-   Create constrains: createconstraints.sql

-   Insert data: insertdata.sql

-   Creates a series of views that will help to simplify the queries (createviews.sql)

2.  Use sql queries to show how the data can be used as evidence for decision-making: decisions.sql

## Decisions

7 decisions related to asset management problems. The content of the decisions is about why the information of the assets is needed and how it will be used by the decision maker (decisions_text.txt).

## Pyramid

A 3-level pyramid including the names of the spatial assets and the their information (spatial_data_management_pyramid.pdf).
